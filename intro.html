<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Information on creating HL2:DM map is very sparse, so I thought I’d start compiling as much info as I could here.</p>
<p>I got this information from a combination of experimention, asking around for assistance, and pulling maps apart by decompiling and then loading them into Hammer.</p>
<p>This documentation isn’t focused on teaching you the basics of Source engine mapping, as there are already good resources for teaching yourself how to map with Hammer (see the “Mapping Tutorials” section for suggested tutorials).</p>
