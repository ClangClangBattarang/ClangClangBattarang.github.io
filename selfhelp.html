<h1>How to self-help your mapping problems</h1>
<p>While you can ask around on various Discord servers (Viperbird's Mapping Contest seems to be the most active for HL2:DM mapping right now), you might not always have that option. This is how I learnt to map for Deathmatch, and hopefully you won't have to go to as far lengths to get what you want out of your map!</p>
<h2>Option 1: Use existing resources and tutorials</h2>
<p>Stuff like the Valve Developer Community (VDC) Wiki, or various YouTube tutorials usually will point you into the right direction. Check the Links section of the site for useful links!</p>
<h2>Option 1: Decompile Existing Maps</h2>
<p>If you want to know how something got made, decompile the map using BSPSource, and load the created .vmf file into Hammer. Sometimes it can be wonky, and you might need to extract the textures from the BSP into a temporary custom folder to even get something that resembles a map, but it's generally the best way to find out how something works in game.</p>
<p>As long as you don't repackage and publish maps claiming them as your own, nobody sane will give a shit.</p>
<h2>Option 2: Better Googling</h2>
<p>Google over the list decade or so has slowly worsened the quality of it's search results in order to prioritise revenue.</p>
<p>However, you can use <a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search">Google's Advanced Search</a> to narrow your search parameters down.</p>
<h3>Generally Useful Flags and Symbols</h3>
<p>These can be used in a general search as well; I find these ones incredibly useful to cut down on the crap Google can sometimes spew on you.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Double quotes</strong> (e.g. <em>"func_door"</em>) - Only include pages with these terms in them</li>
    <li><strong>site:<em>sitename.domain</em></strong> (e.g. site:gamebanana.com) - Only include results from this site</li>
    <li><strong>topic <em>-topicname</em></strong> (e.g. <em>male07 -gmod</em>) - remove search terms with the minus from the search results. Affectionately known as the "Remove Pinterest" flag.</li>
    <li><strong>filetype:<em>file_extension</em></strong>(e.g. filetype:bsp) - This only includes search results for files with that extension on the end. As far as HL2:DM modding is concerned, the main relevant filetypes are vpk, bsp, and bsp.bz2 files</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of these can be combined in one search for even greater precision as well!</p>
